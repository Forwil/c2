Iraqi leaders attempted Thursday to close the widening sectarian divide in the wake of widespread reprisals by Shiite Muslims against Sunnis after the bombing of a Shiite shrine. Iraqi and U.S. officials called for calm, but a powerful Sunni Arab political bloc said it is boycotting national unity talks. A curfew was imposed Thursday evening in Baghdad and three surrounding provinces, which could stir even more controversy because it will remain in effect through Friday's noon Muslim prayers -- the most sacred prayers of the week for followers.
